A complete rewrite of plugin using the excellent paradox/pai python 3 library.
(all credit here - https://github.com/ParadoxAlarmInterface/pai)

Supports Magellan, Spectra and EVO panels.

As mentioned this is complete re-write from the ground up so whilst I can test some panels and scenarios unfortunately I cannot test all!

Needs IP150 Model connected to Alarm System.  Like this one:

# Setup:

Pretty Basic - biggest part is passwords and IP Address:

Passwords as per the Config Screen.

Then Create Main Device:
